# FileRandomizer3000
This is a handy tool to randomize files and copy them to a destination folder.

This tool is awesome for randomization of mp3 files, which are the only files currently supported.
You can randomize MP3 files for an MP3 player, smartphone or Digital Music Changer in your car, such as Yatour and similar devices.

# What the application can do
1. Supply single source folder;
2. Find unique or non-unique files.
3. Find files only inside selected folder or inside its nested folders as well.
4. Limit files by:
  * total size;
  * number;
  * number per each folder.
5. Randomized folders may be renamed to keep their naming random in the destination folder.
6. Randomized files can be compared to the existing files in the destination folder and you can have several options on what should be done with such files when they are encountered:
  * Skip
  * Overwrite
  * Add prefix or suffix
7. Randomized files can be sorted by their name in ascending or descending order.
